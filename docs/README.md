## II - The context :

## 5th Project realized during my training in Web Development with OpenClassrooms School.

The aim of this porject was to implement the backend of a web app of Hot Sauces using NODEJS and ExpressJS and to connect it with a DataBase MongoDB and obviously in following the safety rules.

This web app allows you signup and login to create you own sauces (with picture and description) and to upload it in a dataBase so the other users can see them and add a like or dislike. You can modify your sauce and delete it if you want.

## III - Installation :

### Start the app
